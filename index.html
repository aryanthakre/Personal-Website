      <p>From India.I'm an e-guy with special powers and the capacity to do <br>
      anything . I love to play games and code side-by-side with my studies.<br>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I can do programming along with huge multitaking and can keep up my pace with two or more programs at once. <br>
           Currently I'm learning full web development and looking forward to have many certifications in almost every known language <br>
           unless it's my will .

        <h3>Not a skill but passion.</h3>
        <p>Currently as I'm preparing for IIT-JEE I'm not able to give my full time in programming, as for me IIT-JEE is far way important than programming. <br>
           And to have a future in programming my first priority is to get an admission into the best possible college as a Computer Science student. </p>
